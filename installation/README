# Background

This document guides you through the setup of the operating system for OceanBase.

There are several limitations:

1. The operating system has three disks. The first disk is for the system, the second disk is for OceanBase Clog, and the third disk is for OceanBase data.
2. all operations need super privilege, so need root password, 
3. the user who runs oceanbase is 'admin', if want to change the user, please modify 'init_user.sh'

# Instructions

Run these commands:

```
./init_ob.sh $ROOT_PASSWORD $OB_USER

```

Here's what each parameter means for the script init_ob.sh:
- `$ROOT_PASSWORD`: the password of the root.
- `$OB_USER`: OB_USER: the user who will run OceanBase, default is admin
