### Introduction ###

First step is generate testing data. 
Here are several comments:
1. Currently this script just generate 100G data, user can modify as user can.
2. This script skip to generate sql for TPCH, directly use the default script. user can manual generate the sql, and modify the sql.   

./generate


Second step is loading testing data
./load.sh xxx xxx xxx xxx xxxx xxxx xxxx

Please refer the script for parameter's details. 



Last step is running tpch sql query. 
Do as the following:

./run.py -f mysql/mysql.cfg


### comments ###

In fact, this script is a simple testing script, 
the offical tpch benchmark has much more extra requirement, 
such do write/transaction action during query.


Every step will take much time to execture, user can directly merge all script into one script and execute as the following

nohub ./mysql > mysql.log 2>&1 &
